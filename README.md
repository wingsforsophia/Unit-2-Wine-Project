[WineCellar](http://unit-2-wine-app.herokuapp.com/)

Wine Collecting app designed to be easily used on mobile.

## Background

My husband and I love wine, but never remember which ones we tried. This is for people like us to be able to collect and search for wines we have already tried. 

## Getting Started

Find a wine in the All Wines view or add a new wine! Then you can add or remove it from your wine list. 

Invite your friends to join and see which wines they have liked and tried, as well.
