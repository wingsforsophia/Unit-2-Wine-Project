# Paired

[Paired App](http://unit-2-wine-app.herokuapp.com/)

Wine Collecting app designed to be easily used on mobile.

## Background

My husband and I love wine, but when it's time to grab a bottle, we never remember which ones we tried. This is for people like us to be able to collect and search for wines we have already tried.

## Getting Started

Find a wine in the All Wines view or Add New Wine! Then you can add or remove it from your wine list and favorites and start pairing!

Invite your friends to join and see which wines they have liked and tried, as well.
